## Project: Implementation of Pairs Trading Strategy for Crypto Currency Market
## Project Describtion:
 This research serves as a re-implementation of a popular statistical arbitrage trading technique called pairs trading
 strategy on the cryptocurency market. Mostly it follows the trading strategy described in [1] and [2].Like in [2], we
 look at crypto spots, however, exclude the USDT-marginated futures from the analysis for now1.
 Methodologically, our approach follows the standard pipeline used in equity pairs trading and adapted by [1, 2]: identify
 candidate pairs; test for a stable long-run relationship (e.g., via Engle–Granger residual stationarity); construct a
 spread and standardize it to obtain a trading signal; and execute threshold-based entries and exits while enforcing
 risk controls. While the focus is on a faithful reproduction of the original design, we document each implementation
 choice—data resampling and execution assumptions—so that any deviations from [1, 2] are transparent.
 The central questions we ask are twofold. Firs, do the gains reported for equities and prior crypto studies persist
 on recent Binance spot data? Second, does the choice between arithmetic (non-logged) and logarithmic compound.
 By structuring the study around a single-pair allocation per period, we make these sensitivities visible in a way that
 multi-pair or dollar-neutral baskets can obscure
